# Computer Graphics Lab works
## Introduction
I have added all [algorithms'](#algorithms) implementation with [GLUT](https://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/) library. 

## Instruction
Instruction on How to install GLUT and use the library is attached in the [extra](extra/instruction.docx) folder.

## Instruction for Linux
Linux comes with opengl out of the box. But for these projects you will also need a library GLUT in ubuntu install free glut

`sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev`

I have included a _run.sh_ file in the root which can be used to compile and run any script inside. Or you can use the following command as well. 

`c++ $input.cpp -lGL -lGLU -lglut -o $output`

### Algorithms
1. Introduction (Lab1).
2. DDA Line Drawing Algorithm.
3. Bresenham Line Drawing Algorithm.
4. Mid-point Circle Drawing Algorithm.
5. Drawing Martyr Monument Using Mid-point Circle Algorithm.
6. Solution of lab final questions. Attached with the readme in that folder.
